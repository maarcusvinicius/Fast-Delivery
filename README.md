<br />

Fast Delivery is a project that simulates an online delivery application for snack bars. It allows users to create orders through the web interface and submit them to a database. The orders are then rendered into a mobile application so that the cafeteria staff can fill them and send the orders to the customers.

## 💻 Version Web

    <img alt="fastdelivery" src="./assets/Screenshot_Web_2.png" width="45%">
  </p>
</div>

## 📲 Version Mobile

<div align="center" >
    <p align="stretch">
    <img align="center" height="200" alt="NextLevelWeek" title="#NextLevelWeek" src="./assets/Screenshot_Mobile_1.png">
    <img align="center" height="200"  alt="NextLevelWeek" title="#NextLevelWeek" src="./assets/Screenshot_Mobile_2.png">
    <img align="center" height="200"  alt="NextLevelWeek" title="#NextLevelWeek" src="./assets/Screenshot_Mobile_3.png">
    </p>
</div>

## 🎡 Functionalities

- Creating orders: Users can create their orders through the web application, selecting the desired items and adding them to the cart

- Sending orders: Orders created by users are sent to the database using Prisma

- Viewing orders: Orders sent are rendered in the mobile application, allowing the snack bar to view and track orders received

- Order fulfillment: The snack bar can mark orders as fulfilled in the mobile application, indicating that they are in the process of being prepared or have already been delivered
